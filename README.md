# Callbacks-Project
To run the tests for the above problems you will need to unzip the file you downloaded.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. cd into the project directory
2. npm install to install any dependencies
3. mocha to run the test cases
The mocha command will run all the tests.

P.S. You may notice the package.json/package-lock.json files and node_modules directory. You do not need to edit any of those contents. Those files are what we use to package the project and create the test cases.
